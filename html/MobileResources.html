log information, USM Anywhere analyzes the data generated by your AWS environment and provides real-time alerting to identify malicious activity. When the sensor is deployed 
into your AWS environment, it provides ultimate control over the installation and the data contained within it, and also prevents any external access to your environment.<br />
